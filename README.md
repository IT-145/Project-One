# Project-One: Grazioso Salvare Animal Tracking Application
 
# About the Project
This repository contains the implementation of the Grazioso Salvare Animal Tracking Application, developed as part of my IT 145 course at Southern New Hampshire University. The project demonstrates the application of object-oriented programming principles in Java to build a software solution for tracking search-and-rescue animals.

# Project Summary
Grazioso Salvare, a leading search-and-rescue animal training company, required a software application to track the animals during their training phases and after they are placed into service. This project involved the development of a new Monkey class and the modification of the existing Driver class to manage both dogs and monkeys.

# Key Features
- Monkey Class: Implements attributes specific to monkeys, such as species, tail length, and body length. Inherits from the RescueAnimal class.
- Driver Class: Includes methods to intake new dogs and monkeys, reserve animals, and display lists of animals in service.
- User Interface: A menu-driven interface that handles user input for managing animal data, ensuring robust input validation and error handling.

# Skills Developed
- Object-Oriented Programming: Applied OOP concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to develop maintainable and scalable code.
- Java Programming: Enhanced proficiency in Java through creating classes, managing data with ArrayLists, and implementing user-friendly interfaces.
- Problem Solving: Developed solutions to real-world problems by integrating software design principles and best practices.

# Files in This Repository
- Monkey.java: Contains the implementation of the Monkey class, complete with attributes and methods specific to monkeys.
- Driver.java: The main class that drives the application, including methods for managing animals and handling user interactions.
- RescueAnimal.java & Dog.java: Base classes provided as part of the project setup to manage rescue animals.

# Reflection
This project provided valuable experience in applying coding standards and principles of object-oriented programming. The development process reinforced the importance of clear documentation, effective user input validation, and the application of best practices in software design. These skills will be instrumental in future software development tasks, both in academic and professional settings.
