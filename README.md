# Project-One: Grazioso Salvare Animal Tracking Application
 
# About the Project
This repository contains the implementation of the Pet class, developed as part of my IT 145 course at Southern New Hampshire University. The project demonstrates the application of object-oriented programming principles in Java to model a simple pet management system for a local pet boarding and grooming business, Pet BAG.

# Project Summary
The Pet Boarding and Grooming (Pet BAG) business required a software solution to replace their paper-based pet management processes. This project involved creating a Pet class to represent the essential details of the animals being boarded. The class was designed following object-oriented principles, with attributes and methods to manage pet information effectively.

# Key Features
- Pet Class:
  - Attributes: Represents the type, name, age, and length of stay for a pet. It also includes attributes for managing available dog and cat spaces, as well as the amount due for the pet's stay.
  - Constructors: Includes both a default constructor and a parameterized constructor to initialize pet details.
  - Accessors and Mutators: Provides getter and setter methods for all attributes, ensuring encapsulation and ease of data manipulation.

# Skills Developed
- Object-Oriented Programming:
  - Applied OOP concepts such as encapsulation and the use of constructors, accessors, and mutators.
- Java Programming:
  - Gained proficiency in Java through creating a well-structured class that models real-world objects.
- Problem Solving:
  - Developed solutions for managing pet data in a way that can be easily extended and maintained.

# Files in This Repository
- Pet.java:
  - Contains the implementation of the Pet class, complete with attributes to represent pet details, and methods to manage the pet's information.

# Reflection
This project provided valuable experience in applying coding standards and object-oriented programming principles in Java. The process reinforced the importance of clear documentation, encapsulation, and creating maintainable and scalable code. These skills are crucial for future software development tasks, both in academic and professional settings.
